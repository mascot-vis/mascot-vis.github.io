This is a web app demonstrating how to use Mascot.js to create a data visualization in a web page. To run the app, start a local web server:

Open Terminal (for Mac) or Command Prompt (for Windows)

Navigate to this directory containing index.html

Run a python command which will create an HTTP web server for this current directory and all of its sub-directories. If you're running Python 2.x: 

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

If you're running Python 3.x or higher:

python -m http.server 8080  (or python3 -m http.server 8080)

Now, open your browser and type http://localhost:8080/ in the URL bar and press enter or go. You should see the visualization.
